abstract = " using Lucas Kanade and Farneback optical flow techniques, automatic spatio-temporal analysis of the cardiac flow was analyzed. Quantitative analysis such as ventricle wall tracking and displaying sparse and dense patterns of the vector field to qualitative analysis of displaying local and global maximum velocities of the cardiac flow was done for each frame. Finally, the presence of vorticity during the cardiac flow was calculated by solving the stream function."
