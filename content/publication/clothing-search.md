abstract = "in this work, CNN regressor architectures were explored to automate and minimize the time spent during the treatment planning of brachytherapy. The project was mainly a registration problem where the goal was to predict the transformation parameters of the applicator used during brachytherapy in respect to the tumor. Many experiments were conducted starting with simple few layer deep CNN architecture to more complex architectures. Spatial transformer network (STN) and inverse compositional spatial transformer network (ICSTN) were also incorporated with the localization network. The experiments concluded that a simple localization network pipelined with a series of STN/ICSTN is capable of predicting the transformation parameters of an applicator directly from MRI scans. The project was implemented using Tensorlayer along with Tensorflow."
